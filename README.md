## How to Run Locally

1.  **Clone or download** the `prototype/` folder to your local machine.
2.  **Open** the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
3.  Navigate through the different pages using the main navigation bar.

The prototype is designed to work completely offline, as all necessary Bootstrap and custom files are included in the `assets/` folder.

## Assets Used

* **Fonts**: Oswald and Roboto from Google Fonts.
* **Icons**: Font Awesome (linked via CDN for simplicity in this prototype, but can be downloaded and hosted locally if required).
* **Images**: Placeholder images for team logos and the hero background.
